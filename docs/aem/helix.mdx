Helix is the **next generation** CMS. Its built **author first** and has no developer facing backend.
Everything development wise happens client side. CSS and vanilla JS only, hosted on GitHub.

The main difference to other cms is, that **all** content is hosted exclusively on either SharePoint or GoogleDrive.
Helix grabs that content, transforms it to markdown and HTML. These fragments are being made statically available via fastly CDN.

A client requests the html and executes the referenced scripts. These are a developers only possibility to alter the Websites appearance.
Dom Manipulation, third party requests and CSS Styling transform the generated html into the desired visual outcome.

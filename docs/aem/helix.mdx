[Adobe Helix](https://www.hlx.live) is the **next generation** CMS. Its built **author first** and has no developer facing backend.
Everything development wise happens client side. CSS and vanilla JS only, hosted on GitHub.

The main difference to other cms is, that **all** content is hosted exclusively on either SharePoint or GoogleDrive.
Helix grabs that content, transforms it to markdown and HTML. These fragments are being made statically available via fastly CDN.

A client requests the html and executes the referenced scripts. These are a developers only possibility to alter the Websites appearance.
Dom Manipulation, third party requests and CSS Styling transform the generated html into the desired visual outcome.

Everybody can go through the [official tutorial](https://www.hlx.live/tutorial) and give helix a try. It's free! I highly recommend it - you need roughly 20 minutes.

## Technical Setup

A Helix development domain is constructed from three parts: **Branch Name**, **Repository Name** and **Repository Owner username**.

Example: <https://branchname--reponame--githubusername.hlx3.page/site/path>

<div class="alert alert--info" role="alert">
    üí° As mentioned initially, a Helix Developer works "frontend only". The backend architecture has been summarized well by the development team.

## Best Practices

Merge only via GitHub PullRequest. Add a Helix url to the pull requests branch and utilize the Helix Bot Core Web Vital[^1] analysis for every commit.
This ensures, that you never heavily change a pages' performance to the worse.

    ‚ùó This is especially important, since its fairly easy to mess with a pages' core web vitals via DOM manipulation.
